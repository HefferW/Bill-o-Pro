== Documentation

You can find detailed information about this project in our https://HefferW.github.io/Bill-o-Pro/[documentation].

=== Adoc

For documentation, we opted for https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] instead of Markdown.
AsciiDoc provides a richer syntax and better support for more complex documentation needs, such as including tables, cross-references, and callouts.
Its built-in integration with PlantUML allows us to embed diagrams directly into our documentation, creating a unified and efficient workflow.

=== PlantUML

We chose https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] for creating diagrams in our project because it allows us to focus on the content rather than manual layout adjustments.
With its text-based syntax, diagrams like class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and flowcharts can be generated quickly and kept under version control.
This approach makes collaboration easy, ensures consistency, and integrates seamlessly into our development workflow.
By automating the visualization process, we save time and maintain clarity as the project evolves.
